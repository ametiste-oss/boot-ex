# Introduction
 
This project is targeting to provide the bundle of every-day spring-boot extensions that could be 
used to improve dev-experience in a development environment as well as in a production.

Project structure is designed to be modular, each module is designed to provide the one function or a tool. 
So, if a developer wants to use something cool, there are no need to depend on a bunch of other stuff.

# News
